Memeory management notes

 - overall memory manager that can track global information about allocations
 - should return shared_pointer/unique_pointer? This will need to explicitly state the destructor
 - each engine component will have its own memory manager
 - Global manager should manage a heap, that the new function will be overridden to point to
 -
